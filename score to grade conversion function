NOTE, this project was mstly successful and I did it on my own! no stack overflow required, just looked through my notes on if, else if, and else statements. The one hang-up I had was on th equality statements =, ==, ===. 
Make sure to note what eqaulities are what. = gives a value to a variable but doesn't check type. == is rarely used. === gives value to a variable AND checks for type. That's why I could use === for the A++ socre, but not for the others
